# SquadSync - Senior Design Project
## Purpose 
SquadSync is a mobile application that allows users to create and join groups with friends. These groups or ‘Squads’ can then display a wide variety of daily fun and interesting information about the joined members which can then be nicely displayed as a view inside the app..
## Requirements
### Sign in/Sign up 
- Allow users to create an account that will give them a username and a way to identify themselves.
- A user has to create an account in order to access the features of creating or joining a group.
### Create/Join a Group
- Once signed in users will choose between creating or joining an existing group.
- When a group is created a unique 5 digit code will be generated that users can use to invite others and join through the app.
- Users can enter the unique invite 5 digit code to join an existing group. This code can be set to expire after a certain amount of time or remain permanent.
### Set Group Settings
- Group members can toggle between different group settings to display on the widget or in the app.
- Filters and settings include: location tracking, health/fitness tracking, music status and image uploading.
- Group members can customize their groups further by changing the name and editing their profile nicknames that are displayed.
### User Profile
- Users will be able to access a wide variety of profile settings to better help their experience.
- Allow options to modify the app’s appearance such as nicknames and light or dark mode.
- Additional help such as tutorials, more information, and private policies will be included in this section.
### View Group Information
- Depending on the group setting selected, an overview of that selection will be available to the users in the group to view.
- This can include: charts, leaderboards, trends, and recent status updates.
- Will also require permissions from the user's mobile device.
